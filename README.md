#Bro - My personal rant listener, helper, goto bot

####Why am I building this?

Frankly I want to pick my brains on how I can integrate a few cool things and make something that is useful for me.

####What cool things? How will it work?

I am going to make a command line tool called **remindmebro**. It will ask me, "what" and "when". This is going to go sit on a google doc, via sheestsu and when the time has come, it will remind me using [pynotify](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py-notify). Let's see how far we get with this.

I could, in the future use this to download links, or automate them, torrents etc. I plan to call it **fetchitbro**. I hope this project is over in a few days though. Ha!

Next step is to integrate this with pynotify or growl for mac.
